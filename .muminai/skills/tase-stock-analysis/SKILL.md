# TASE Stock Analysis

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Analysis Type
Ask the user what kind of analysis they need:

| Type | Hebrew | Description | Key Data |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Index tracking | מעקב מדד | TA-35 or TA-125 index performance | Index composition, weight, performance |
| Single stock | ניתוח מניה | Individual TASE-listed stock analysis | Price, volume, fundamentals |
| Dual-listed | חברה דואלית | Companies listed on TASE + NASDAQ/NYSE | Arbitrage, currency effect, tax implications |
| Maya filing | דיווח מאי"ה | TASE disclosure filings lookup | Material events, financial reports, insider trades |
| Capital gains | רווחי הון | Tax calculation on securities gains | 25% tax rate, exemptions, offsetting losses |

### Step 2: Gather Market Data
Depending on the analysis type, collect:
- **Index data:** Use `scripts/fetch_tase_data.py` to retrieve TA-35 or TA-125 composition and weights
- **Stock data:** Ticker symbol (TASE uses Hebrew names or numeric codes), current price, volume
- **Dual-listed data:** Both TASE ticker and US ticker (e.g., NICE on TASE and NICE on NASDAQ)
- **Maya filings:** Company name or securities number, date range for filings

### Step 3: Apply Israeli Context
For any stock analysis, layer in Israeli-specific factors:
- **Bank of Israel interest rate:** Current BOI rate affects valuations and sector rotation
- **Shekel/Dollar exchange rate:** Critical for dual-listed arbitrage and foreign exposure
- **Sector composition:** Israeli market heavy in banking (Hapoalim, Leumi, Discount), pharma (Teva), tech
- **Market hours:** TASE trades Monday-Friday. Monday-Thursday 09:59-17:14, Friday shortened session 09:59-13:50. No trading on Saturday (Shabbat) or Jewish holidays

### Step 4: Calculate Capital Gains Tax (Mas Revach Hon)
When the user has sold or plans to sell securities:

| Scenario | Tax Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Individual, non-substantial shareholder | 25% | Standard rate on net gain |
| Substantial shareholder (over 10%) | 30% | Flat rate on entire gain (Section 91(b)(2)) |
| High-income individual | + surtax (mas yesef) | An additional surtax applies to capital income above the annual threshold (~721,560 NIS for 2025-2027): 3% base + a further 2% from 2025 = up to 5% on the slice over the threshold, on top of the 25%/30%. A high earner's effective rate on securities gains can reach ~30%. |
| Shares eligible for inflationary adjustment (varies by acquisition date and asset type) | Exempt | Only real gain is taxed, consult current regulations |
| Offsetting losses (kizuz hefsedim) | Allowed | Losses offset gains in same tax year |
| Foreign resident | Treaty-dependent | Check double taxation treaty |

Calculation:
```
net_gain = sale_price - purchase_price - transaction_costs
tax = net_gain * 0.25  # or 0.30 for substantial shareholder (10%+)
```

### Step 5: Evaluate Dual-Listed Opportunities
For dual-listed companies (e.g., Check Point, CyberArk, NICE, Sapiens):
1. Compare TASE price (in NIS) vs. US price (in USD) using current exchange rate
2. Account for ADR ratio (some dual-listed have different share ratios)
3. Factor in different trading hours (TASE and US markets now overlap on Monday-Friday, but Friday TASE closes early at 13:50)
4. Note tax treaty implications -- Israeli residents pay Israeli capital gains tax regardless of which exchange. For a share bought or sold in USD, the Israeli taxable gain is computed in shekels, so the shekel/dollar movement between purchase and sale is part of the taxable gain (not a separate FX item). US tax withheld is generally creditable against the Israeli tax under the Israel-US treaty (zikui mas zar) to avoid double taxation

### Step 6: Review Maya Filings
Check relevant disclosures on the Maya system (TASE disclosure platform):
- **Immediate reports:** Material events that affect stock price
- **Periodic reports:** Quarterly and annual financial statements
- **Related party transactions:** Insider trades and holdings changes
- **Shelf offerings:** Potential dilution events

Summarize key findings and flag any material items.

### MCP Integration: Live TASE Data

For live market data, use the **TASE MCP Server** ([skills-il/tase-mcp](https://github.com/skills-il/tase-mcp)).

**Prerequisites:**
- TASE Data Hub API key (register at https://openapi.tase.co.il/tase/prod/, some products are paid)
- MCP server installed: `npx github:skills-il/tase-mcp`

**Setup:**
Set the environment variable `TASE_API_KEY` with your API key.

**Available MCP Tools:**
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `tase_list_securities` | List all traded securities |
| `tase_get_security` | Get security details by ID |
| `tase_get_security_eod` | End-of-day price data |
| `tase_list_indices` | List all TASE indices |
| `tase_get_index_eod` | End-of-day data for an index |
| `tase_get_index_components` | Index composition with weights |
| `tase_get_maya_announcements` | Maya company filings |
| `tase_get_management_positions` | Board and management holdings |

**Note:** The TASE API requires a paid subscription for some products. Without MCP, this skill provides analysis guidance using general market knowledge. With MCP, the agent fetches live market data directly from the official TASE Data Hub.

## Examples

### Example 1: TA-35 Index Overview
User says: "Show me the current TA-35 composition and top performers"
Actions:
1. Run `python scripts/fetch_tase_data.py --index TA35`
2. Display top holdings by weight (Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, ICL, Teva, etc.)
3. Show recent performance vs. BOI interest rate context
4. Note upcoming ex-dividend dates for major components
Result: Summary table of TA-35 with weights, performance, and key metrics

### Example 2: Dual-Listed Arbitrage Check
User says: "Compare Check Point stock price on TASE vs NASDAQ"
Actions:
1. Fetch Check Point TASE price (in NIS) and NASDAQ price (in USD)
2. Convert using current BOI representative rate (sha'ar yatzig)
3. Calculate premium/discount between exchanges
4. Note that arbitrage is limited by settlement timing and currency conversion costs
Result: Price comparison with exchange rate analysis and practical arbitrage assessment

### Example 3: Capital Gains Tax on Stock Sale
User says: "I sold Teva shares for 120,000 NIS, bought them for 80,000 NIS. What's my tax?"
Actions:
1. Identify: Net gain = 120,000 - 80,000 = 40,000 NIS
2. Check: Standard rate (25%) assuming non-substantial shareholder
3. Calculate: Tax = 40,000 * 0.25 = 10,000 NIS
4. Note: Can offset against any capital losses (hefsedei hon) from same tax year
Result: Capital gains tax of 10,000 NIS, with guidance on loss offsetting and filing

### Example 4: Maya Filing Lookup
User says: "Check recent Maya filings for Bank Hapoalim"
Actions:
1. Look up Bank Hapoalim on Maya (securities number 662577)
2. Filter recent immediate reports and periodic filings
3. Summarize material events (dividends, board decisions, regulatory actions)
4. Flag any insider trading reports
Result: Summary of recent disclosures with material items highlighted

## Gotchas
- Since January 2026, TASE trades Monday through Friday (previously Sunday-Thursday). Friday sessions are shortened (09:59-13:50). Agents trained on pre-2026 data may still assume Sunday-Thursday trading and schedule queries on Sundays, which are now non-trading days.
- TASE ticker symbols follow a different format than US exchanges. Israeli stocks use numeric securities codes alongside short Hebrew names. **Always verify a security number before using it** by hitting `https://market.tase.co.il/en/market_data/security/{number}` (e.g., 662577 = Bank Hapoalim, 604611 = Bank Leumi). TASE securities also carry long-standing English alpha symbols (e.g. POLI = Hapoalim, LUMI = Leumi, TEVA, NICE, CHKP, ICL) alongside the numeric codes; prefer the alpha symbol for clarity (note Leumi's symbol is LUMI, not LEUMI). These symbols are not new, they have existed for years. Never hardcode security numbers from memory; fetch them from the TASE OpenAPI by company name.
- **Equity settlement is T+1.** Israel transitioned to T+1 settlement for equities; foreign investors may negotiate T+2 with their broker. The skill's pre-2024 references to T+2 across the board are stale.
- Israeli stock prices on TASE are quoted in agorot (1/100 of a shekel), not in shekels. Agents may display raw prices without dividing by 100, showing prices 100x too high.
- Dual-listed Israeli companies (e.g., Teva, Check Point) trade on both TASE and NASDAQ with different prices due to exchange rate fluctuations. Agents may not reconcile the price difference.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "TASE ticker not found"
Cause: TASE uses numeric securities numbers and Hebrew names, not US-style tickers
Solution: Search by company Hebrew name or securities number (mispar niyar erech). Use Maya search for lookup.

### Error: "Exchange rate mismatch for dual-listed"
Cause: Using stale or non-representative exchange rate for comparison
Solution: Use Bank of Israel representative rate (sha'ar yatzig) published daily at 15:30. For intraday, note rates are indicative only.

### Error: "Capital gains calculation unclear"
Cause: Complex scenarios like partial sales, inflationary adjustments, or inherited shares
Solution: For shares eligible for inflationary adjustment (varies by acquisition date and asset type), consult current tax regulations for specific dates. For inherited shares, acquisition cost is market value at inheritance date. Consult a tax advisor (yo'etz mas) for complex cases.
