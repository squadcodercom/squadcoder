# Israeli Startup Toolkit

## Description

Help Israeli founders execute the legal, tax, and funding mechanics of building a startup in 2026: registering a חברה בע"מ at the Israeli Corporations Authority (Rasham HaChevarot), choosing an Israel Innovation Authority program (Tnufa, R&D Fund, incubator, BIRD, Horizon Europe, Yozma 2.0), structuring SAFE or convertible-note rounds under Israeli law, setting up a Section 102 trustee plan, applying for Preferred Technological Enterprise status, and deciding whether to do a Delaware Flip.

Use when the user asks about any of these mechanics. Do NOT use for non-Israeli company formation, US tax advice, or cap-table modeling of public-company stock; route those elsewhere. For deep coverage of Section 102 employee tax (the employee side), prefer `israeli-stock-options-tax`. Always recommend a licensed Israeli lawyer and רואה חשבון before binding decisions; this skill produces drafts and checklists, not legal opinions.

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** This skill provides general guidance only. Israeli corporate law, tax law, and securities regulation are complex and change frequently (the 2025 Arrangements Law and OECD Pillar Two QDMTT both took effect for tax years starting after 31 December 2025). Always consult with a licensed Israeli lawyer and accountant before binding decisions.

### Step 1: Identify Startup Stage

| Stage | Typical Needs | Key Actions |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Idea / Pre-seed | Company formation, initial funding | Register Ltd, apply to Tnufa |
| Seed | First investment, team building | SAFE/convertible note, Option 102 plan |
| Series A | Growth funding, scaling | Priced round, Preferred Technological Enterprise status |
| Growth | Expansion, international | IP regime, binational grants, Delaware Flip decision |

### Step 2: Company Formation

**Register an Israeli Ltd (חברה בע"מ):**

```
Step-by-step registration:

1. Choose company name
   - Check availability: ica.justice.gov.il
   - Must be unique, Hebrew or English
   - Suffix: בע"מ (Ltd)

2. Prepare Articles of Association (takanon)
   - Standard template available from Companies Registrar
   - Customize: share classes, board composition, transfer restrictions
   - Recommended: Use lawyer-drafted articles for startups

3. Appoint initial directors
   - Minimum: 1 director
   - Israeli residency not required (but practical for banking)
   - Director ID (teudat zehut) or passport for foreign directors

4. Register online
   - Portal: ica.justice.gov.il
   - Registration fee 2026: NIS 2,614 (one-time)
   - Annual fee: NIS 1,338 if paid by 31 March 2026, NIS 1,777 from 1 April 2026
   - First-year exemption: no annual fee in the calendar year of registration
   - Timeline: 3-7 business days
   - Documents: Articles, director appointments, registered address

5. Post-registration
   - Open corporate bank account (Bank Leumi, Hapoalim, Discount, Mizrahi-Tefahot)
     Digital options: Pepper Business (Leumi), One Zero
   - Register for tax at local tax office (pakid shuma)
   - Register for VAT if expected revenue exceeds threshold
     - Osek Patur ceiling 2026: NIS 122,833 (most tech companies skip straight to Osek Murshe / Chevra)
     - Standard VAT rate as of 2026: 18% (raised from 17% on 1 January 2025)
   - Register for National Insurance (Bituach Leumi) as employer
```

**Founder share allocation example:**
```python
def calculate_founder_allocation(founders, vesting_months=48, cliff_months=12):
    """Calculate founder share allocation with vesting."""
    total_shares = 10_000_000  # Common Israeli startup starting point
    allocation = []

    for founder in founders:
        shares = int(total_shares * founder["percentage"] / 100)
        allocation.append({
            "name": founder["name"],
            "shares": shares,
            "percentage": founder["percentage"],
            "vesting_months": vesting_months,
            "cliff_months": cliff_months,
            "shares_at_cliff": shares * cliff_months // vesting_months,
            "monthly_vesting_after_cliff": shares // vesting_months,
            "share_class": "Ordinary",
        })

    return {
        "total_authorized": total_shares,
        "allocations": allocation,
        "unallocated": total_shares - sum(a["shares"] for a in allocation),
        "note": "Reserve 10-15% for employee option pool (ESOP)"
    }
```

### Step 3: Innovation Authority Grants

**IIA program selection (2026):**

| Program | Stage | Funding | Max Amount | Repayment |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Tnufa (Ideation) | Pre-seed | Up to 80% | Up to NIS 200,000 over 12 months (NIS 250K budget cap) | Royalties 3-5% |
| Startup Fund | Pre-seed / seed | Up to 50% (up to 75% periphery) | Per budget, typical NIS 2-5M | Royalties 3-5% |
| R&D Fund | Seed-Growth | Up to 50% (up to 75% periphery) | Per budget | Royalties 3-5% |
| Technological Venture Incubator | Early stage | Up to 85% | Up to ~NIS 9M over 2 years | Royalties + incubator equity |
| BIRD General (US-Israel) | Any | Up to 50% | USD 1.5M | Royalties if reach sales |
| BIRD HLS (Homeland Security) | Any | Up to 50% | USD 1M | Royalties if reach sales |
| Horizon Europe | Any | Varies | Varies | Depends on track |
| Yozma 2.0 (fund-of-funds) | Seed-Series A | Co-investment with institutional LPs | Varies (USD 700M first round, 2024) | Equity, not a startup grant |
| Magnet / Magneton / Nofar | Academic-industry | Varies | Varies | Royalties / non-repayable for academic side |

Yozma 2.0 is an LP-side government commitment that backs Israeli VC funds at a roughly 0.3:1 government:institutional ratio; founders do not apply directly. The 2024 government stimulus also created a Revolutionary Startup Fund that co-invests with private investors in pre-seed, seed, and Series A rounds.

**Grant application checklist:**
```
IIA R&D Fund Application:

- Company registered in Israel
- R&D conducted primarily in Israel
- IP owned by the company (not founders personally)
- Technological innovation (not just business model)
- Detailed R&D plan (12-24 months)
- Budget breakdown (salaries, subcontractors, materials, equipment)
- Team qualifications (CVs of key R&D personnel)
- Market analysis and business potential
- No parallel funding for same R&D from other government sources
- Commitment to report progress and financials

Application portal: innovationisrael.org.il
Review period: 2-4 months typically
Approval rate: ~40-50% for R&D Fund
```

**Key IIA restrictions:**
- IP developed with IIA funding cannot be transferred abroad without approval
- Transfer fee: up to 6x the grant amount received
- Royalty payments: 3-5% of revenue until grant repaid (with interest)
- Manufacturing preference: IIA prefers production in Israel
- Annual reporting requirements on funded R&D

### Step 4: Investment Agreements

**Israeli SAFE template structure (Y Combinator post-money SAFE is the de-facto norm in Israel; Israeli law applies via choice-of-law clause):**
```
Israeli SAFE Key Terms:

1. Investment Amount: [Amount] NIS or USD
2. Valuation Cap: [Cap] (post-money standard, pre-money still seen in older templates)
   Typical 2026 caps: USD 3-8M pre-seed, USD 8-20M seed
3. Discount Rate: 15-25% typical (20% common)
4. Governing Law: Laws of the State of Israel (or Delaware if flipped)
5. Dispute Resolution: Tel Aviv courts / arbitration
6. Conversion Trigger: Equity Financing of at least [Amount]
7. MFN Clause: [Yes/No] Most Favored Nation
8. Pro-rata Rights: [Yes/No] right to participate in next round
9. Israeli Tax: Subject to Israeli tax withholding on conversion

Important Israeli-specific clauses:
- IIA notification (if company received grants)
- Section 102 interaction (for employee investors)
- Israeli securities law exemptions (private placement, max 35 offerees in 12 months)
- Anti-money laundering compliance (Hok Issur Halbanat Hon)
```

**Convertible note vs SAFE comparison:**
```
                    SAFE            Convertible Note
Interest rate:      None            5-8% annually
Maturity date:      None            12-24 months
Repayment:          No              Yes (at maturity if no conversion)
Israeli tax:        On conversion   Interest taxed annually
Complexity:         Simple          More complex
Investor protection: Lower          Higher (debt status)
Common in Israel:   Pre-seed/seed   Seed/bridge rounds
```

### Step 5: Option 102 Setup

**Set up employee stock option plan:**

```
Option 102 Capital Gains Track Setup Steps:

1. Draft ESOP (Employee Stock Option Plan)
   - Hire Israeli employment/tax lawyer
   - Define: pool size, vesting schedule, exercise price, trustee

2. Select ITA-approved trustee
   - Major trustees: Bank Leumi Trust, Bank Hapoalim Trust, ESOP Excellence,
     IBI Trust, Altshuler Shaham Trust
   - Fee: Setup fee + annual per-participant fee

3. File plan with Israel Tax Authority (ITA)
   - Submit plan document to local pakid shuma
   - 30-day objection period (ITA can object or modify)
   - Plan effective after 30 days if no objection

4. Grant options to employees
   - Board resolution for each grant
   - Option agreement signed by employee
   - Trustee notified and manages deposit

5. Vesting and holding period
   - Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
   - 24-month holding period from the END OF THE TAX YEAR of grant
     (NOT 24 months from grant date, a common mistake)
   - Shares held by trustee during holding period

6. Exercise and sale
   - Employee exercises options (pays exercise price)
   - After holding period: capital gains tax 25% flat
     (+ 3% surtax above the high-income threshold, indexed annually)
     (30% if employee holds 10%+ of company as a controlling shareholder)
   - Trustee handles withholding and reporting
```

**Option 102 tax comparison:**
```python
def compare_option_102_tracks(grant_value, exercise_price, sale_price,
                              high_earner=False):
    """Compare tax outcomes for Option 102 tracks (2026 rates)."""
    gain = sale_price - exercise_price
    surtax = 0.03 if high_earner else 0.0

    capital_gains_track = {
        "track": "Capital Gains (Trustee)",
        "holding_period": "24 months from end of tax year of grant",
        "tax_rate": 0.25 + surtax,
        "tax_amount": gain * (0.25 + surtax),
        "net_to_employee": gain * (0.75 - surtax),
        "employer_deduction": False,
    }

    income_track = {
        "track": "Income (Trustee)",
        "holding_period": "12 months from end of tax year of grant",
        "tax_rate": 0.50,
        "tax_amount": gain * 0.50,
        "net_to_employee": gain * 0.50,
        "employer_deduction": True,
    }

    non_trustee = {
        "track": "Non-Trustee 102 (3(i) for non-employees)",
        "holding_period": "None",
        "tax_rate": 0.50,
        "tax_amount": gain * 0.50,
        "net_to_employee": gain * 0.50,
        "employer_deduction": True,
    }

    return [capital_gains_track, income_track, non_trustee]
```

### Step 6: R&D Tax Benefits

**Tax benefit eligibility check (2026):**
```
Preferred Enterprise (Mafal Mutaaf):
- Conditions: 25%+ revenue from exports
- Tax rate: 7.5% (Area A / Negev / Galilee) or 16% (elsewhere)
- Applies to: Industrial or tech companies

Preferred Technological Enterprise (PTE / Mafal Tehnologi Mutaaf):
- Conditions: Significant R&D activity, IP ownership in Israel
  - R&D expenses >= 7% of revenue for 3 prior years, OR
  - R&D expenses > NIS 75M per year
  - At least 20% of revenue from IP developed in Israel
- Tax rate: 12% on qualifying IP income (7.5% in Area A)
- Reduced withholding on dividends (4-20%)

Special Preferred Technological Enterprise (SPTE):
- For very large groups (consolidated revenue > NIS 10 billion)
- Tax rate: 6% on qualifying IP income (nexus approach)

R&D Expense Deduction (Section 20a):
- Full deduction of R&D expenses in the year incurred
- Applies to: All R&D conducted in Israel
- No need for IIA approval (separate from grants)

Angel Law (Section 20c):
- Individual investors can deduct up to NIS 5M investment
- Company must be a qualifying R&D company
- Investment in first 4 years of company life
- Deduction spread over 3 years

OECD Pillar Two QDMTT (effective tax years from 1 Jan 2026):
- Multinational groups with global revenue >= EUR 750M
- Top-up tax if effective Israeli rate < 15%
- PTE companies may need to model exposure
```

### Step 7: Delaware Flip Decision

By 2025 roughly 45% of newly-formed Israeli tech startups incorporated abroad first (Delaware C-Corp parent + Israeli R&D subsidiary), up from ~20% in 2022. The driver is the US VC ecosystem, not Israeli law.

```
Delaware Flip Decision Checklist:

Strong reasons to flip (or start as Delaware parent):
- Plan to raise from US-only VCs (most Tier-1 funds prefer C-Corp)
- US-based founding team or US-first GTM
- M&A by US acquirer is the likely exit
- Plan to issue US-style stock options to US employees

Reasons to stay Israeli-only:
- Plan to claim Preferred Technological Enterprise (12% / 7.5%)
- Plan to take IIA grants (transfer-abroad approval and 6x penalty risk)
- Israeli investors prefer Israeli entity
- Small / bootstrapped, no foreign capital plan

Flip cost: USD 25K-75K legal + tax pre-ruling, 2-4 months timeline.
Tax pre-ruling (mas mukdam) from ITA recommended to avoid deemed exit tax.
IIA approval required if any IIA grants received before the flip.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: New Startup Registration
User says: "I want to register a new tech startup in Israel with my co-founder"
Actions:
1. Guide through company name check at ica.justice.gov.il
2. Recommend standard articles with startup-friendly provisions
3. Calculate founder allocation (e.g., 50/50 with 4-year vesting)
4. List post-registration steps (bank, tax, VAT at 18%, Bituach Leumi)

Result: Step-by-step registration guide with allocation table.

### Example 2: IIA Grant Application
User says: "We want to apply for Innovation Authority funding for our AI product"
Actions:
1. Assess stage and recommend program (Tnufa up to NIS 200K for early, R&D Fund or Startup Fund for later)
2. Walk through application requirements
3. Highlight IP restrictions and royalty obligations (3-5%)
4. Provide budget template guidance
5. Note that grant acceptance constrains a future Delaware Flip
Result: Program recommendation with application checklist.

### Example 3: ESOP Setup

1. Recommend Option 102 Capital Gains Track
2. Suggest pool size (10-15% of company)
3. Recommend trustee options (Bank Leumi Trust, ESOP Excellence, IBI, Altshuler Shaham)
4. Outline filing process with ITA (30-day objection period)
5. Provide standard vesting terms (4y / 1y cliff)
6. Explicitly state the holding period is 24 months from the END of the tax year of grant
Result: Complete Option 102 setup plan with trustee comparison.

### Example 4: Delaware Flip
User says: "We want to raise from a US VC, should we flip to Delaware?"
Actions:
1. Map fund preferences and exit path
2. Run flip decision checklist (Step 7)
3. Flag IIA grant constraint and transfer-abroad approval
4. Recommend pre-ruling from ITA (mas mukdam) before executing

## Gotchas

- Israeli startups register as "Chevra Baam" (Ltd) at the Israeli Corporations Authority (Rasham HaChevarot), not at a US Secretary of State. Foreign-trained agents may describe US incorporation processes.
- Tnufa is capped at NIS 200,000 over 12 months (80% of a NIS 250K budget), NOT 1 million NIS. Skills or articles citing 1M NIS are stale.
- The Section 102 capital-gains holding period is 24 months from the END of the tax year of grant, not 24 months from the grant date. Grants in late December can effectively extend this by almost a year.
- IIA-funded IP must stay in Israel; transfer abroad requires approval and a fee of up to 6x the grant received. This constrains the Delaware Flip and many M&A deals.
- Israeli VAT rose to 18% on 1 January 2025 (from 17%). Pricing pages, invoices, and accounting templates copied from older sources are stale.
- Closely-held companies (5 or fewer shareholders) face a new 2026 rule allocating undistributed profits to shareholders and taxing them at marginal rates (up to 50%) instead of the 23% corporate rate. This is a structural shift for solo / small founder companies.
- Israeli tax year runs January to December (like the US), but corporate filing deadlines differ. Standard corporate tax rate is 23%. PTE rate is 12% (7.5% in Area A), NOT 16%; SPTE is 6%. Older skills citing 7.5% / 16% are using the older Preferred Enterprise tiers, not the PTE tech-specific rates.
- Israeli startups that flip to Delaware typically incorporate Delaware C-Corp as parent with the Israeli entity as a subsidiary, not the reverse. Agents may suggest the opposite.
- The Companies Registrar annual fee has a calendar-quarter cliff: NIS 1,338 if paid by 31 March 2026, NIS 1,777 from 1 April 2026. Pay in Q1 to save NIS 439.

## Israeli Ecosystem Context (2024-2026)

After the October 2023 war, Israeli startup funding contracted in late 2023 then partially rebounded through 2024-2025, with cyber, AI infrastructure, and defense tech absorbing most growth-stage capital. Key data points:

- **Funding volume**: 2024 raised roughly USD 12B across ~600 rounds per Start-Up Nation Central; 2025 H1 trended ahead of 2024 driven by AI and cyber megadeals.
- **Government stimulus**: The 2024 high-tech stimulus injected roughly USD 1B into the ecosystem over 2024-2026, including the Yozma 2.0 fund-of-funds (0.3:1 government:institutional ratio, USD 700M first round in Q3 2024) and a new Revolutionary Startup Fund co-investing in pre-seed / seed / Series A.
- **Active local VCs**: Pitango (multi-stage, ~USD 2B AUM), Aleph (Series A/B), 83North (Series A/B), Vertex Ventures Israel (early growth), Vintage Investment Partners (Vintage X closed at USD 400M+ in 2024, secondaries plus fund-of-funds), OurCrowd (online platform plus partner funds), Viola Group, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), TLV Partners, Glilot Capital (cyber), Team8 (cyber/AI foundry), Insight Partners (heavy IL deployment), Amiti Ventures (early stage).
- **Accelerators / programs**: MassChallenge Israel (zero-equity, Jerusalem), OurCrowd Pitch (pitch competition plus syndicate), 8200 EISP (alumni-driven), Microsoft for Startups Israel, Google for Startups TLV. Bizzabo is an Israeli scale-up, not an accelerator; correct any agent that says otherwise.
- **Recent exits / IPOs**: Mobileye (NASDAQ 2022), Wix (NASDAQ 2013), Lemonade (NYSE 2020), Riskified (NYSE 2021), monday.com (NASDAQ 2021); 2024-2025 saw renewed M&A (Wiz reportedly in advanced talks with Google for ~USD 23B in 2024, status confirmed in 2025) and several mid-cap cyber acquisitions.
- **Delaware Flip trend**: Roughly 45% of new Israeli tech startups incorporated abroad in 2025 (up from ~20% in 2022), almost always Delaware C-Corp parent with Israeli R&D subsidiary. Driver is US VC preference, not Israeli law.
- **Tax landscape**: Corporate tax 23% (unchanged through 2026). VAT 18% (raised from 17% in January 2025). PTE rate 12% (7.5% Area A); SPTE 6%. Section 102 capital-gains rate 25% (+ 3% surtax for high earners). OECD Pillar Two QDMTT applies for tax years starting after 31 December 2025. New closely-held-company rule (5 or fewer shareholders) re-allocates undistributed profits to shareholders at marginal rates. Always verify current rates with the ITA before quoting.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "IIA rejected our application"
Cause: Insufficient technological innovation, weak R&D plan, or budget issues.
Solution: Request feedback from IIA reviewer, strengthen innovation component, consider reapplying in next cycle. IIA allows resubmission.

### Issue: "Option 102 holding period not met"
Cause: Employee left or shares sold before 24 months from the end of the tax year of grant.
Solution: Tax difference applies. Gain taxed as employment income (up to 50%) instead of capital gains (25%). Trustee withholds at the higher rate. Plan for this in employment agreements and grant timing.

### Issue: "Cannot transfer IP abroad"
Cause: IIA-funded IP has transfer restrictions.
Solution: Apply to IIA for transfer approval. Be prepared to pay transfer fee (up to 6x grant amount). Consider structuring with an Israeli subsidiary retaining IP, or negotiate the transfer as part of an M&A deal.

### Issue: "Delaware Flip and IIA grants conflict"
Cause: Flipping to a US parent triggers IIA review of any funded IP.
Solution: Get IIA written approval and an ITA pre-ruling (mas mukdam) before executing the flip. Budget the transfer fee. Some founders choose to repay outstanding royalties early to simplify approval.
