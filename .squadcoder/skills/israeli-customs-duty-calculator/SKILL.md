# Israeli Customs Duty Calculator

## Problem

Importing goods into Israel (whether a single Amazon order or a commercial shipment) triggers up to three separate taxes: customs duty, VAT, and purchase tax (mas kniya). Thresholds shift (the personal exemption moved from $75 to $150 in December 2025, was annulled back to $75 by the Knesset on 24 February 2026, and was re-set to $130 by a new Finance Ministry order the next day, and reverted to $75 on 1 June 2026 when that temporary order expired), duty depends on an 8-digit HS code that is not the same as the US or EU code, and free-trade preferences only help when you produce the right origin proof. Buyers constantly over- or under-estimate the landed cost.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the import type

| Type | Typical user | Tax treatment |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Personal import, small parcel | Consumer ordering online | Exemption threshold applies (see Step 2) |
| Personal import, high-value | Consumer buying jewelry, electronics | Full duty + VAT + purchase tax |
| Commercial import (B2B) | Osek Murshe importing stock | Full duty + VAT, no threshold exemption; VAT is recoverable |
| Gift | Individual sending to an Israeli | Treated as personal import, no special exemption |
| Aliyah / oleh hadash belongings | New immigrant | Separate oleh exemption, consult the Aliyah unit |

**Courier vs postal clearance:** how the parcel arrives changes who clears it. Courier shipments (DHL, FedEx, UPS) are self-cleared by the courier, which then bills the importer the duty, VAT, and a handling fee. Israel Post parcels go through a separate postal clearance process: low-value items can clear automatically, while items above the threshold get a payment demand the recipient settles before delivery. The tax math is the same either way; the fees and timeline differ.

### Step 2: Check the personal import threshold

As of June 2026, the personal import exemption is USD 75 (cost of goods, excluding shipping and insurance). This figure is exceptionally unstable: it was raised from USD 75 to USD 150 in late December 2025, the Knesset revoked that order on 24 February 2026 (reverting to USD 75), the Finance Minister signed a new order setting it to USD 130 effective midnight 24-25 February 2026, and that temporary order expired on 1 June 2026, returning the threshold to USD 75. It has moved four times in seven months, so treat any value quoted here as provisional and confirm it against the live official calculator before quoting a number.

- Below USD 75: no customs, no VAT, no purchase tax (full exemption)
- USD 75 to USD 500: VAT 18 percent applies on the product value; customs duty is waived under the personal-import regime; purchase tax can still apply on specific items
- Above USD 500: full duty + VAT + purchase tax. Above USD 1,000 the shipment is treated as commercial and requires a customs broker and a full import declaration (rashimon).

**Important carve-out**: the exemption does NOT apply to tobacco products, e-cigarettes, alcohol, or alcoholic beverages. Those are taxed in full from the first shilling, regardless of value.

Confirm the current threshold via the official Personal Import Tax calculator at `https://shaarolami-query.customs.mof.gov.il/CustomspilotWeb/PersonalImportTax` or the gov.il service page at `https://www.gov.il/en/service/customs-tax-calculation-import-by-israelis` before quoting a number to the user. The personal-import threshold has changed four times in seven months.

### Step 3: Classify the product into an 8-digit HS code

Israel uses the international Harmonized System at the 6-digit level plus 2 Israel-specific digits (positions 7 and 8) that refine the classification for local duty and purchase tax rules.

1. Describe the product: material, function, packaging form, use, brand, model.
2. Start from the 2- or 4-digit HS chapter (e.g. chapter 85 for electronics, chapter 61 for apparel).
3. Look up the full 8-digit code in Shaar Olami: `https://shaarolami-query.customs.mof.gov.il/CustomspilotWeb/en/CustomsBook/Import/Doubt`.
4. Do not guess the last 2 digits. If unsure, ask Israeli Customs for a free pre-ruling (binding classification).

### Step 4: Look up the duty rate, VAT rate, and purchase tax

From the Shaar Olami entry for the HS code, read:
- Customs duty rate (typically 0 to 12 percent depending on category; many goods are duty-free due to MFN bindings)
- VAT rate: 18 percent standard since 1 January 2025
- Purchase tax: only on specific items (alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, some electronics, passenger cars)

### Step 5: Calculate the CIF value

Israel Customs values goods at CIF: cost + insurance + freight.

```
CIF_ILS = (product_price + shipping + insurance) * USD_to_ILS_rate
```

Use the Bank of Israel daily rate for the clearance date. The `boi-exchange` MCP returns the current rate; see "Recommended MCP Servers" below.

### Step 6: Compute the full landed cost

The three taxes are calculated on a cascading base. Use `scripts/calculate_duty.py` to avoid arithmetic mistakes.

```
duty       = CIF * duty_rate
base_after_duty = CIF + duty
purchase_tax = base_after_duty * purchase_tax_rate
base_for_vat = base_after_duty + purchase_tax
vat        = base_for_vat * 0.18
landed_cost = CIF + duty + purchase_tax + vat + broker_fees + handling
```

### Step 7: Check for FTA preference

A valid origin proof can eliminate the duty (but not VAT or purchase tax).

| Origin | Agreement | Origin proof |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| United States | US-Israel FTA (1985) | US Origin Invoice Declaration on the commercial invoice |
| European Union | EU-Israel Association Agreement, PEM 2012 rules (Israel has not ratified revised PEM) | EUR.1 movement certificate, or invoice declaration under 6000 euros |
| United Kingdom | UK-Israel Trade and Partnership Agreement (2019) | EUR.1 movement certificate, or invoice declaration under 6000 euros |
| Canada | Modernized CIFTA (September 2019) | Form B239 certificate of origin |
| EFTA (CH, NO, IS, LI) | EFTA-Israel Free Trade Agreement | EUR.1 movement certificate |
| Mercosur (BR, AR, UY, PY) | Mercosur-Israel FTA (in force June 2010) | Mercosur-Israel certificate of origin |

See `references/fta-preferences.md` for details and pitfalls.

## Examples

### Example 1: Amazon order under the threshold

User says: "I'm ordering a 60 dollar keyboard from Amazon US. Will I pay tax?"

Actions:
1. Personal import, product value below the USD 75 threshold (as of June 2026).
2. No customs duty, no VAT, no purchase tax.
3. Warn that shipping charges are NOT counted toward the threshold as long as they are itemized separately on the invoice. If shipping is bundled into the product price, the combined figure is tested.
4. Note: the same keyboard at 120 dollars would NOT be exempt today. It exceeds the USD 75 threshold and would owe about 18 percent VAT (the USD 130 window that once covered it expired on 1 June 2026). The threshold has changed four times in seven months, so verify via the official calculator before quoting.

Result: No import tax at 60 dollars. Landed cost equals the US price plus shipping.

### Example 2: 200 dollar camera above the threshold

User says: "How much will I pay in import tax for a 200 dollar camera from Amazon?"

Actions:
1. Personal import, product value above USD 75 but under USD 500. VAT applies, customs duty is waived under the personal-import regime.
2. Classify camera: HS chapter 85 (electrical machinery), likely 8525.89.xx range. Look up exact 8-digit code in Shaar Olami.
3. Apply 18 percent VAT on the CIF value (product + shipping + insurance, converted to ILS at the Bank of Israel rate). For a personal import the CIF is typically just the product value plus itemized shipping.
4. Customs duty: 0 percent under the personal-import waiver for values up to USD 500 (and 0 percent for digital cameras under MFN even at higher values).
5. Purchase tax: generally none for cameras (check Shaar Olami for the specific 8-digit code).
6. Run `python scripts/calculate_duty.py --value 200 --shipping 20 --duty-rate 0 --purchase-tax-rate 0 --fx 3.65 --personal`.

Result: Approximate tax of 18 percent of (200 + 20) USD converted to ILS, plus a courier or postal handling and clearance fee charged on top (the amount varies by carrier). Confirm via the official calculator.

### Example 3: Commercial EU import with EUR.1

User says: "I'm importing 50 units of Italian leather bags, CIF 12000 euros, HS 4202.21.xx. What paperwork do I need?"

Actions:
1. Commercial import; no personal exemption applies.
2. Classify to the full 8-digit code via Shaar Olami; duty on leather bags is often in the 6 to 12 percent range.
3. Because CIF is above 6000 euros, require a EUR.1 movement certificate stamped by Italian customs.
4. Duty is waived under the EU-Israel agreement provided the EUR.1 is valid.
5. VAT at 18 percent on (CIF + duty) is still due.
6. Israel does NOT accept electronic signatures on EUR.1; the supplier must post the original.

Result: Origin-preferred landed cost is CIF plus 18 percent VAT plus broker fees. Without a valid EUR.1, full duty applies.

## Gotchas

- The personal-import threshold is exceptionally volatile: USD 75 to USD 150 by a Finance Ministry order in late December 2025, back to USD 75 when the Knesset revoked that order on 24 February 2026, USD 130 by a fresh Finance Ministry order signed less than 24 hours later (effective midnight 24-25 February 2026), and back to USD 75 when that temporary order expired on 1 June 2026. Four moves in seven months. The current standard is USD 75. Always verify the current value via the official calculator before quoting a number.
- The exemption does NOT cover tobacco, e-cigarettes, alcohol, or alcoholic beverages. Those pay VAT and purchase tax from the first shilling regardless of value.
- Shipping and insurance are part of CIF for commercial imports but are excluded from the personal-import threshold test as long as they are itemized separately on the invoice. If shipping is bundled into the price, the combined figure is tested.
- The last two digits of an Israeli 8-digit HS code are Israel-specific. A US HTS code or an EU CN code does not translate directly; confirm the Israeli code in Shaar Olami.
- FTA preference removes the customs duty only. VAT 18 percent and purchase tax (where applicable) still apply regardless of origin.
- EUR.1 must carry a wet-ink (original) signature. Israel does not accept electronically signed EUR.1 certificates. Plan courier time for the original to arrive.
- Purchase tax is NOT a small rounding item. Alcohol and tobacco can carry rates in the hundreds of percent. Do not assume only VAT applies.
- Packages above USD 1,000 are treated as commercial regardless of who is buying. You will need a customs broker and a full import declaration (rashimon).
- Israel Post holds parcels with unpaid customs charges in a bonded warehouse. Storage is free for the first 30 days from arrival notice; daily storage fees apply afterwards. Pick up or pay online via `israelpost.co.il` before the storage window closes.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "My landed cost estimate is way off"

Cause: Forgetting that VAT is calculated on CIF + duty + purchase tax, not on the product price alone.

Solution: Recompute using the cascading formula in Step 6, or run `scripts/calculate_duty.py`. Add courier or broker handling and clearance fees separately; these vary by carrier and are charged on top of duty and VAT.

### Error: "Customs rejected my EUR.1"

Cause: Electronic signature, missing supplier declaration, or shipment above 6000 euros without an EUR.1 when only an invoice declaration was issued by a non-approved exporter.

Solution: Request an original wet-ink EUR.1 from the EU exporter's customs authority. For repeat shipments, the exporter should apply for approved-exporter status so invoice declarations cover any value.

### Error: "HS code I used gives a different duty in the US"

Cause: US HTS and Israeli customs tariff share the first 6 digits but diverge in positions 7 to 8.

Solution: Re-look the product up in Shaar Olami. If you need certainty, request a free pre-ruling from Israeli Customs with a product description and catalog.
