# Supported Israeli Banks and Credit Card Companies

Authoritative list reflects the `CompanyTypes` enum in [eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers/blob/master/src/definitions.ts). The library is the foundation for both `israeli-bank-mcp` and `il-bank-mcp`. Library version pin: `israeli-bank-scrapers >=6.7.x` (current release 6.7.4, 2026-04-20).

BOI Code column shows Bank of Israel identification codes from the [BOI Payment Systems Oversight list](https://www.boi.org.il/en/economic-roles/supervision-and-regulation/payment-systems-oversight/access-to-payment-systems/identification-codes/). `—` means no separately-assigned BOI code (the entity shares a parent's code or is not listed as an independent payment-system participant).

## MCP Server Coverage

Not every scraper in the upstream library is exposed by every MCP wrapper. Check the specific MCP's tool list before assuming an account is reachable.

### israeli-bank-mcp (Motti Bechhofer)
- Most comprehensive coverage of upstream library
- Directly wraps `israeli-bank-scrapers`
- Supports 2FA
- Active maintenance
- Repo: <https://github.com/mottibec/israeli-bank-mcp>

### il-bank-mcp (Gilad Lekner)
- Docker-based deployment
- Adds transaction analysis features (spending breakdowns, recurring charge detection)
- Uses SQLite for local data storage
- Best when running headless / serverless via the puppeteer-core variant
- Repo: <https://github.com/glekner/il-bank-mcp>

## Authentication Notes
- All Israeli banks require 2FA (two-factor authentication)
- Bank scrapers use headless browser automation
- Sessions expire after ~15-30 minutes
- Some banks may temporarily block automated access
- Rate limiting varies by bank

## Data Available
- Account balances
- Transaction history (bank-dependent window; Hapoalim and Leumi typically expose shorter than 12 months, FIBI group exposes 12+ months)
- Credit card transactions
- Standing orders
- Loan information (limited)
