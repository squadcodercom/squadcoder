# Israeli Budget Planner

## Key Financial Rates
| Rate | Value (Reference) |
|------|-------------------|
| BOI Interest Rate | 3.75% (as of May 2026; verify at boi.org.il) |
| Prime Rate | BOI + 1.50% = ~5.25% |
| VAT (Ma'am) | 18% |
| Minimum Wage | 6,443.85 NIS/month (35.40 NIS/hr), from 1 Apr 2026 |
| Average Wage | ~13,566 NIS/month (Jan 2026) |

## Mashkanta (Mortgage) Tracks
| Track | Rate Type | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Prime-linked | Variable | Prime +/- 0.5% |
| Fixed unlinked | Fixed | 4.5%-6.5% |
| CPI-linked fixed | Fixed + CPI | 3.0%-5.0% + CPI |
| CPI-linked variable | Resets every 5 yrs | 2.5%-4.5% + CPI |

BOI rules: Max LTV 75% first home, 70% home replacement, 50% investment. Mix rule: a minimum of 1/3 must be fixed-unlinked; up to 2/3 may be variable/prime (the old 1/3-prime cap was removed in January 2021).

## Arnona (Municipal Property Tax)
Arnona is set by each municipality and updated annually, so per-city numbers go stale fast. Do not rely on a static table. Fetch the city's current-year arnona order (tzav arnona, 2026) from the municipality's website (or via the israeli-cbs MCP for indices). Rates are quoted per square meter and vary by zone and property classification.

Illustrative only: a mid-size Tel Aviv residential property may run roughly 500-1,500 NIS/month depending on size and zone (2026, verify with the municipality).

## Household Health Costs (Mas Briut / Health-Tax)
Israeli budgets must include the mandatory health-tax (mas briut / dmei briut) deducted from salary, plus optional supplemental insurance:
- Health-tax (employee, 2026): 3.23% of salary up to the reduced-collection step (7,703 NIS/month), 5.17% above it (deducted with Bituach Leumi).
- Kupat cholim supplemental insurance (bituach mashlim, e.g. Maccabi Zahav / Clalit Mushlam): an optional monthly budget line on top of the basic health basket (sal briut) that taxes already fund.
The `scripts/budget_calculator.py` script applies the 3.23% / 5.17% health-tax rates automatically.

## Monthly Budget Template (Couple + 1 Child)
- Housing: 4,000-8,000 (25-35%)
- Food: 2,500-4,500 (15-25%)
- Education: 1,500-3,500 (8-15%)
- Transportation: 500-1,500 (3-8%)
- Arnona: 400-800 (3-5%)

## Savings Vehicles
- Keren Pensia: Tax-deductible, locked until retirement
- Keren Hishtalmut: Tax-free after 6 years
- Kupat Gemel: Capital gains exempt, 6-year lock

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Monthly Household Budget
User says: "Help me plan a monthly budget for a family in Tel Aviv"
Actions:
1. Input gross salary, calculate net after tax (brackets: 10%-50%)
2. Deduct Bituach Leumi employee rate (1.04% reduced / 7% full, split at 7,703 NIS/month), health tax (3.23% / 5.17%), pension (6% min, 6.5% common)
3. Budget categories: rent/mortgage (30-40%), groceries (15%), transport (10%), utilities (8%), childcare
4. Include arnona estimate for Tel Aviv (fetch the municipality's current-year rate)
5. Savings target: keren hishtalmut + pension + emergency fund
Result: Complete monthly budget with Israeli-specific deductions and savings plan

### Example 2: Evaluate a Mashkanta (Mortgage) Option
User says: "Should I take a fixed or variable rate mortgage in Israel?"
Actions:
1. Compare mortgage tracks: Prime-linked, fixed (kvua), CPI-linked (tzamud madad)
2. Calculate a blended-track payment. A single prime-only run (e.g. the script default 5.25%) is illustrative and understates reality: BOI rules force at least 1/3 fixed-unlinked (4.5-6.5%), so compute 1/3 fixed at ~5.5% plus 2/3 prime at 5.25% and sum, or label the single-rate result "prime-only, blended will be higher"
3. Apply Bank of Israel's PTI cap (max 50% of disposable income; banks usually decline above 40%)
4. Budget mandatory mortgage life insurance and structural insurance (bituach chaim / bituach mavne) as a recurring required cost (typically ~100-300 NIS/month, varies by loan size, age, and property), not just a one-off
5. Compare total cost over 15/20/25 year terms
Result: Mortgage comparison with monthly payments, the insurance line, and total cost per track

## Gotchas
- Agents often use US mortgage conventions (30-year fixed rate) for Israeli mortgages. Israeli mashkantaot use a mix of tracks (maslulim): Prime-linked, CPI-linked fixed, CPI-linked variable, and fixed-rate unlinked, with typical terms of 15-30 years.
- Bituach Leumi (National Insurance) deductions are mandatory for all Israeli workers and reduce take-home pay significantly. Agents may omit these from budget calculations, using gross salary as available income.
- Israeli rent is commonly quoted as monthly amounts excluding arnona and va'ad bayit (building maintenance). Agents may compare rents without accounting for these additional fixed costs that can add 500-2,000 NIS/month.
- The Hishtalmut fund (keren hishtalmut) is a unique Israeli savings vehicle with tax benefits. Agents unfamiliar with Israeli financial products may suggest generic savings accounts instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Tax calculation doesn't match pay slip"
Cause: Tax credits (nekudot zikui) not properly applied
Solution: Every Israeli resident gets 2.25 base credit points. Women get 0.5 additional. New immigrants get extra credits for 3.5 years. Each point is worth 242 NIS/month (2026; verify current value with the tax authority). Apply credits before calculating tax.

### Error: "Arnona amount seems wrong"
Cause: Arnona varies significantly by city, zone, and property classification
Solution: Arnona is municipality-set and updated annually. Do not use a static table. Fetch the relevant municipality's current-year tzav arnona (2026) for the exact per-square-meter rate by zone and property class.
